# Code of Conduct

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth.

When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community and together we can learn from and be inspired by each other about all things Free and Open Source.

## Our Community

Members of the Python community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
* **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

We value your participation and appreciate your help in realising this goal!

## Presenting

All presentation material should be suitable for people aged 12 and above.

If the subject matter of the presentation cannot be presented adequately without including language that could be considered offensive, this should be pointed out in advance, at the beginning of the talk and in the schedule.

If presenters are unsure whether their material is suitable, they are encouraged to show it to the conference’s speaker liaison or mailing list/forum moderators before their session.

## Participating

We need to talk openly about our code and behavioural expectations. We welcome having conversations about the kind of things we will and won’t tolerate.

There is *no* problem if someone slips up or occasionally makes a mistake -- this happens to everyone and we’re all trying to learn and develop. If you’re worried about slipping up, endeavour to be understanding and caring. If you’re worried that you have slipped up, be open and apologetic and try to improve based upon the experience.

Yet there is ongoing behaviour that makes other people feel wary and unwelcome. Unfortunately, occasionally there are individuals whose negative patterns of behaviour are persistent and for whatever reason will not change under regular circumstances. If there is a pattern of ongoing/persistent disrespect the organisers will find it necessary to step in and have a conversation with the individual involved. If the poor behaviour extends beyond such a conversation there will be further consequences following guidance provided here: https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement/


To alleviate vagueness, we have outlineds some lists of specific conduct that is inappropriate and unwelcome: https://github.com/canberra-python/README/conduct/list.md
