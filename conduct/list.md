This is **not** our code of code. Our code of conduct is here: https://github.com/canberra-python/README/conduct/README.md

In following is a description of explicitly inappropriate conduct, so we can be clear about some of the standards we expect.

## Inappropriate Presentation Materials

Any public presentation which is part of any event, including but not limited to keynotes, presentations, lightning talks, addresses, mailing list posts and forums, is subject to this code of conduct and thus may not contain:

* sexual or violent imagery;
* exclusionary language;
* insults or ad-hominem attacks.

Presenters are asked to avoid language which is not appropriate for an all-ages audience as much as possible.

## Inappropriate Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment of any participants in any form
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
* Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks
* Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule
* Excessive swearing
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

## Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at Canberra Python events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately.

## Consequences

*Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.*

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Canberra Python community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets. Organisers will follow the guidance provided here: https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement/

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
